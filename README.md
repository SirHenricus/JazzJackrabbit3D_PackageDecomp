# Jazz The Jackrabbit 3 Demo Package File Decompilation

Jazz The Jackrabbit 3 is a cancelled game developed by World Tree Games and was intended to release sometime around 2000. An alpha build dated 1999 was eventually leaked to the public. The game runs on Unreal Engine 1.

This is a decompilation of the .u package files containing all the assets and source code files for the game's demo, which I have done with other UE1 based games. I used the game's UnrealEd executable (called Jazz3dEd) to export all the UnrealScript source code files from the package files and used [WOTgreal](https://ut99.org/ut99.org/viewtopic.php?t=14963) to export it's other assets.

Like I have done with other games, I don't really plan on using any of this to make a patch for the game or anything like that, I was just curious about how the game worked.

None of the code or assets have been modified. Though I did get the package files from a patched verison of the game's demo, so this may not be entirely accurate.
